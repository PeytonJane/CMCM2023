The Spotted Lanternfly Problem #2

We are tasked with modeling a strategy to safeguard vineyards from the invasive Spotted Lanternfly (SLF).
The current practice involves reactive application based on observed SLF thresholds, with distinct criteria 
for nymphs in the spring and adult SLF in late summer. The dilemma arises when adult lanternflies coincide 
with the harvest season, forcing wineries and vineyards to choose between potential fungal diseases caused 
by delayed harvest due to insecticide use or risking long-term vine damage from SLF sap feeding if 
insecticides are postponed until after harvest. This problem necessitates an optimal strategy that 
potentially adjusts the threshold based on SLF migration patterns, time remaining until harvest, cumulative 
chemical usage, and predicted weather conditions impacting fungal disease development. The challenge extends
beyond financial considerations to include the potential impact on other beneficial insects, emphasizing the
need for a comprehensive approach that balances effective SLF control with ecological sustainability.
